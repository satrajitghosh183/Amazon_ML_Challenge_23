# Amazon_ML_Challenge_23
Our attempt at Amazon ML challenge 23


Hello there! I participated in the Amazon ML Challenge 23 along with my team. Unfortunately, we could not get the best results in the competition due to some unforeseen circumstances.

As we were preparing for our upcoming exams, we could not dedicate as much time as we would have liked to work on the challenge. Our initial solution got us a very low score and ranked us around 267 towards the end of the last day.

We tried our best to optimize the solution within the limited time available but we were unable to improve our rank. Unfortunately, we did not have more time to check on it due to our academic commitments.

Despite the disappointing outcome, we had a great learning experience working on the challenge. We gained valuable insights into the world of machine learning and were able to develop our skills in this area.

The initial solution is in the folder labeled as Amazon ML Challenge and our later attemp where we did a lot of research and used a completely new methodlogy as well approach to the problem  is labelled as Amazon ML Challenge sttemp 2
